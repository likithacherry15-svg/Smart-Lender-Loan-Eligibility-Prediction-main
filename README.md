# 📌 Project Overview

Smart Lender is a **Machine Learning-powered Loan Eligibility Prediction System** developed using **Python**, **Flask**, and **XGBoost**.

The application predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for loan approval based on personal and financial information. It enables banks and financial institutions to make faster, more consistent, and data-driven lending decisions.

The trained Machine Learning model is integrated into a Flask web application and deployed on the **Render Cloud Platform** for real-time prediction.
